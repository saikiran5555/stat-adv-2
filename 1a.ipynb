    "The Probability Density Function (PDF), on the other hand, is used for continuous random variables. These are variables that can take on an infinite number of values within a given range. The PDF describes the likelihood of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one specific value.\n",

    "Type of Variable: PMF is used for discrete random variables, while PDF is used for continuous random variables.\n",
    "Interpretation: In PMF, the value of the function gives the probability of the random variable being exactly a certain value. In PDF, the value of the function is not a probability but rather a density; the probability is given by the area under the PDF curve within a range of values.\n",
    "Sum vs. Integral: The total of all probabilities in a PMF (sum over all possible values) is 1, while the total area under a PDF curve (integral over all possible values) is 1."
