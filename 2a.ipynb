    "Why CDF is Used\n",
    "Understanding Distributions: The CDF provides a comprehensive view of the probability distribution of a random variable. It helps in understanding the spread and the central tendency of the data.\n",

    "Probability Calculations: It is useful for calculating the probability that the variable takes a value within a certain range. For instance, \n",

    "(\n",
    "�\n",
    ")\n",
    "P(a<X≤b)=F(b)−F(a).\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-parametric Analysis: CDFs are not tied to any specific type of distribution (like normal, binomial, etc.). Thus, they are useful in analyzing data sets that don't necessarily follow a known distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison of Distributions: CDFs can be used to compare the underlying distributions of different data sets. This is particularly useful in fields like statistical hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-World Applications: In practice, CDFs are used in various fields such as finance (for risk assessment), meteorology (for precipitation probabilities), engineering (for failure rates), and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Cumulative Density Function is a fundamental tool in probability and statistics, providing detailed insights into the behavior of random variables and forming the basis for various analytical and practical applications."
