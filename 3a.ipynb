    "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric around its mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. It has numerous applications in real life and in various fields due to its unique properties. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Situations Using the Normal Distribution\n",
    "Measurement Errors: In physical sciences, measurement errors often follow a normal distribution. Small errors are more common than large errors, assuming that there is no systematic error in the measurement process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Height and Weight: The distribution of heights and weights of a large population tends to follow a normal distribution, with most people having heights and weights around the average, and progressively fewer people as you move towards extremely tall or short, heavy or light individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Scores: In education, test scores often roughly follow a normal distribution, where most students score near the average, with fewer students scoring very high or very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock Market Returns: In finance, the returns of a stock or a portfolio over a short period often approximate a normal distribution, though it should be noted that real-world financial data can sometimes exhibit heavy tails (i.e., more extreme events than the normal distribution would predict).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling Distribution: In statistics, when random samples are taken from a population and the means of these samples are calculated, these sample means tend to form a normal distribution, as per the Central Limit Theorem, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters of the Normal Distribution\n",
    "The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (μ):\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean determines the center of the distribution.\n",
    "It is the point about which the distribution is symmetric.\n",
    "In a graph of the normal distribution, it is the peak of the curve.\n",
    "Standard Deviation (σ):\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation controls the spread of the distribution.\n",
    "A smaller standard deviation means the data are clustered closely around the mean, resulting in a steeper bell curve.\n",
    "A larger standard deviation implies data are spread out over a wider range of values, leading to a flatter bell curve.\n",
    "Shape of the Distribution\n",
    "The shape of a normal distribution is always symmetric and bell-shaped.\n",
    "The mean divides the curve into two equal halves.\n",
    "The standard deviation determines how \"spread out\" the distribution is. The curve gets wider and flatter with a larger standard deviation and narrower and steeper with a smaller standard deviation.\n",
    "In any normal distribution, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% falls within three standard deviations (this is known as the 68-95-99.7 rule or the empirical rule)."
