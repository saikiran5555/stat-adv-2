    "The z-score, also known as a standard score, is a statistical measure that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. It is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. The z-score is a key concept in statistics and is used in various applications.\n",

    "Definition of Z-score\n",
    "The z-score is calculated using the following formula:\n",

    "X is the value being measured.\n",

    "Importance of Z-score\n",
    "Standardization: Z-scores transform data from different datasets to a common scale. This is particularly useful when comparing scores from different distributions, making it easier to understand how a particular score compares with the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identification of Outliers: Z-scores help in identifying outliers in a dataset. A z-score with an absolute value greater than 2 or 3 is typically considered to be an outlier, as it lies more than 2 or 3 standard deviations away from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison Across Different Data Sets: Since z-scores are standardized, they allow for the comparison of scores from different datasets with different means and standard deviations. For example, comparing test scores from two different years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis for Other Statistical Tests: Many statistical tests, such as the t-test, ANOVA, and chi-square tests, use z-scores or the principles underlying them. They form the basis for hypothesis testing in inferential statistics."
